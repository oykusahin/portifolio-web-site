          In this section you will find detailed case studies of projects I have worked on.
          Each case study outlines the problem, my approach, the technologies used, and the outcomes achieved.
          These studies highlight my problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and ability to deliver impactful solutions.
          Also, you can see the system design of each project to understand the architecture and workflow better.
